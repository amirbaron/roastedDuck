# Catalog OID lifecycle parity

The public C API controls in shell-final-gaps-20261025/oids-{cpp,rust}-1 create two
independent in-memory database instances in one process, inspect them, create/fail/no-op/
rename/comment/drop-create objects in one, inspect the untouched instance, close both,
and open a third. Runtime function-image paths and native image hashes are recorded.

CPPinitial database OID is20624in each instance for this frozen build. Rust advances
21187,22378and23659because CatalogEntry::next_oid uses one process-global atomic.
Rename/comment preserve table IDs on both. Bootstrap and later allocation order differ
as well; fixing instance ownership alone cannot claim numeric parity. These are actual
observations, not permission to hardcode a display value or reset a global counter while
other instances live.

Frozen CPPDatabaseManager owns next_oid initialized20000. CatalogEntry constructors
obtain IDs from their catalog's DatabaseManager, and attached database registration
consumes the same allocator. Introduce instance-owned allocation shared by system,
attached and temporary catalogs; preserve standalone catalog/test construction and MVCC
entry-copy identity semantics. Trace constructors, defaults/lazy builtins, conflict paths,
merge/copy allocation and attach/load order before claiming full numeric parity.

Use public controls and independent instances to prove allocation isolation, uniqueness,
object identity through metadata changes, failure/no-op allocation behavior and restart/
attach persistence. Run appropriate signed catalog/engine/client/corpus checks after a
shared change. CPPbuild-specific bootstrap ordering must be matched by real construction
behavior, not by a magic offset, display rewrite or cached reference results. Other shell
and client/performance acceptance gates remain open.
